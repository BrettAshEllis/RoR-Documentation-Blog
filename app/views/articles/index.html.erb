<h1>Articles</h1>

This blog has <%= Article.public_count %> articles and counting!

<ul>
  <% @articles.each do |article| %>
    <% unless article.archived? %>
      <li>
        <%= link_to article.title, article %>
      </li>
    <%= end %>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<%= link_to "New Article", new_article_path %>

# Create a hyperlink to the new article page.
# The first argument is the plaintext for the link. The second argument is the path to the page.
# The link_to helper method is used to create a hyperlink to another page using the first argument as plaintext for the link and the second argument as the path to the page.

# Added class methods from the Visible concern (.archived & public_count are both defined in Visible and are included in the Article and Comment model allowing access to said methods.)
